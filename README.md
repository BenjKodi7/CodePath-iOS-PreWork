Submitted by: Benjamin Kodi

Color Changer is an app that changes the color of the background everytime a button is pressed!

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite apps (and how I would improve/change them):
  - Spotify
      - allow for background customization. Maybe coordinates with time of day
      - allows for two or more songs to always be linked together (even when shuffled in a playlist)
  - Youtube
      - change the font of video description and comments
      - make it possible to like a video while in full screen
  - Tiktok
      - After 3-5 repeats, the next video should play
      - make ads less obnoxious/in the way of videos
      - do not include my sent videos in a thread of another person's sent videos

## Notes

Some challenges that I faced while making this app include:
  - linking the UI of the button to the color change logic
  - changing the fonts and background colors for the words as well
    as the button


## Planning

I would love to create an app called Fitting Room.

This app will use CGI (Computer Generated Images), Deepfake technology, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in order to make it possible for the user to see how certain clothes, accessories, hairstyles/colors, piercings, etc. would look on them. The previews will be as realistic as possible and move in congruence with the user.
